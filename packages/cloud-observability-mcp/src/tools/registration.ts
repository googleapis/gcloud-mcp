          An empty filter matches all log entries in the resources listed in resource_names.
          Referencing a parent resource that is not listed in resource_names will cause the filter to return no results.

          Examples:
          - To find all error-level logs: 'severity="ERROR"'
          - To find logs from a specific GCE instance: 'resource.type="gce_instance" AND resource.labels.instance_id="1234567890123456789"'

          Some examples:
            To filter for latency greater than or equal to a value, do latency:[DURATION] (e.g. 'latency:1s', 'latency:500ms')
            For a prefix string match on the root span name, do root:[NAME_PREFIX] (e.g. 'root:main.api.HTTP')
            For an exact string match on the root span name, do +root:[NAME] (e.g. '+root:main.api.HTTP Get')
            To filter by HTTP status code: 'http.status_code:[CODE]' (e.g. 'http.status_code:500')
            To filter by method: 'method:[METHOD_NAME]' (e.g. 'method:Get')`
