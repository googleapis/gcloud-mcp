# Code owners are automatically requested for review when someone opens a pull
# request containing files matching the given path. The syntax for file paths
# is the same as .gitignore.

# Default owners: The owners for all files in the repo.
* @googleapis/gcloud-mcp-team

# Folder specific owners. Order is important; the last matching pattern takes
# the most precedence. All entries should grant permission to @googleapis/gcloud-mcp-team.
