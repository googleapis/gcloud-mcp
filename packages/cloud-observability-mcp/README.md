# Google Cloud Observability MCP Server

> [!NOTE]
> Like the overall repository, this MCP server is currently in prerelease, and
> may see breaking changes until the first stable release (v1.0).
> * This repository is providing a _solution_, not an officially supported
> Google _product_. This project is not eligible for the
> [Google Open Source Software Vulnerability Rewards Program](https://bughunters.google.com/open-source-security).
> * This project may break when the MCP specification changes, when other
> SDKs change, or when other solutions or products change.
> * This solution is expected to be run by customers **at their own risk**.

This server connects
[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) clients (like
the [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)) to various
**Google Cloud Observability APIs**. It acts as a local bridge, translating
natural language commands from your CLI into the appropriate API calls to help
you **understand, manage, and troubleshoot** your Google Cloud environment.

> To learn more about the underlying services, see the official documentation:

> * [Cloud Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/docs)
> * [Cloud Trace](https://cloud.google.com/trace/docs)
> * [Error Reporting](https://cloud.google.com/error-reporting/docs)

## üöÄ Getting Started

For prerequisites and setup instructions, please see the [root README](../../README.md#-getting-started).

### Authentication

You need to authenticate twice: once for your user account and once for the application itself.

```shell
# Authenticate your user account to the gcloud CLI
gcloud auth login

# Set up Application Default Credentials for the server.
# This allows the MCP server to securely make Google Cloud API calls on your behalf.
gcloud auth application-default login
```

#### Setting the Quota Project

All API requests made by this server require a Google Cloud project for
billing and API quota management. This is known as the "quota project". This
project will likely already be set in the gcloud CLI. The project selected as
the quota project will need to have the APIs you wish to use in Observability
enabled or you will see errors when attempting to use their related tools (e.g.
you need the Cloud Logging API enabled in the quota project to use the
list_log_entries tool).

If you need to control which project is used for quotas, run the following command (https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default/set-quota-project):

```shell
# Set the project to be used for API quotas and billing by ADC
gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project YOUR_QUOTA_PROJECT_ID
```

This ensures that all API usage from this server is attributed to the correct project.

## Usage

Once the server is configured, you can ask your MCP client natural language questions about your Google Cloud environment. Here are a few examples:

*   **"Show me all logs with a severity of ERROR."**
*   **"What is the average CPU utilization for my GCE instances over the last hour?"**
*   **"List all traces from the past 30 minutes."**
*   **"Are there any new error groups in the last day?"**

Your MCP client will translate these questions into the appropriate tool calls to fetch the data from Google Cloud.

## Tools Reference
