# ☁️  Google Cloud MCP

Google Cloud offers a suite of specialized
[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)
servers that make Google Cloud products directly accessible to AI agents.

Our MCP servers work with any tool that can act as an MCP client, including
Claude Desktop, Cline, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Gemini Code Assist, Visual Studio
Code Copilot Editor, Windsurf, and more.

**Available MCP Servers**

| Name       | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| gcloud MCP        | Interact with Google Cloud via the gcloud CLI using natural language prompts. |
| Observability MCP | Access Google Cloud Observability APIs to query logs, metrics, and traces. |


## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with an MCP server, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

## ✨ Setup your MCP server

To use an MCP server, add the following configuration:

```
"mcpServers": {
  "gcloud-mcp": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@google-cloud/gcloud-mcp"]
  },
  "observability-mcp": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@google-cloud/observability-mcp"]
  }
}
```

Here are specific instructions for some popular tools:

### Gemini CLI and Gemini Code Assist

To configure Gemini CLI or Gemini Code Assist to use the gcloud MCP server as a
[Gemini CLI extension](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/extension.md), run:

```
$ npm i -g @google-cloud/gcloud-mcp
$ gcloud-mcp init --agent=gemini-cli
```

This will create the following files in your current working directory:

- `.gemini/extensions/gcloud-mcp/gemini-extension.json`
- `.gemini/extensions/gcloud-mcp/GEMINI.md`

### Claude Desktop

To configure Claude Desktop to use an MCP server, edit the
`claude_desktop_config.json` file. You can open or create this file from the
**Claude > Settings** menu. Select the **Developer** tab, then click **Edit Config**.

### Cline

To configure Cline to use an MCP server, edit the
`cline_mcp_settings.json` file. You can open or create this file by clicking the
MCP Servers icon at the top of the Cline pane, then clicking the **Configure MCP
Servers button**.

### Cursor

To configure Cursor to use an MCP server, edit either the file
`.cursor/mcp.json` (to configure only a specific project) or the file
`~/.cursor/mcp.json` (to make the MCP server available in all projects).

### Visual Studio Code Copilot

To configure a single project, edit the `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your
workspace.

To make the server available in every project you open, edit your
[user settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/personalize-vscode).
